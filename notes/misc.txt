Using github login for Auth0

Create a new serverless app:
  sls create --template aws-nodejs-typescript

One serverless stack OUTPUTS a value for its resource, in the resources section
Other Serverless stack imports it.
  1. in custom section: creates a section for it
  2. those values are then used inside the provider section. The environment section of the provider defines variables with the values from the custom section
  3. Now these environment variables can be used throughout the project, in IAM roles etc

^^ Note: One can use pseudo-parameters, but this 'Outputs' and importing.. is a better/cooler way of doing things
