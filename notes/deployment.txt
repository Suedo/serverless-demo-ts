1. needed to create a new aws IAM user with programatic access as well as console access
2. needed to create a new aws profile ( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html ) 
    Otherwise, sls deploy was taking default profile, which was my wingspan profile
    In serverless.yaml file, mention newly created profile under provider:
      profile: slsuser

serverless.yml config for new DynamoDB table:

 resources:
   Resources:
     AuctionsTable:
       Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
       Properties:
         TableName: AuctionsTable
         BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
         AttributeDefinitions:
           - AttributeName: id
             AttributeType: S
         KeySchema:
           - AttributeName: id
             KeyType: HASH

getting logs of cron events (invoked through `rate` event rule)
sls logs -f processAuctions --startTime 1h // to get logs of the function processAuctions for last 1 hour
sls logs -f processAuctions --startTime 1m // for last 1 minute
sls logs -f processAuctions // all logs. (for me shows only last 10)

Where can you see these rules:
Amazon EventBridge > Events > select ur event > Rules


If you want to keep the event off, but invoke your function manually:
sls invoke -f processAuctions -l
