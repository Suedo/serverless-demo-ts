1. needed to create a new aws IAM user with programatic access as well as console access
2. needed to create a new aws profile ( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html ) 
    Otherwise, sls deploy was taking default profile, which was my wingspan profile
    In serverless.yaml file, mention newly created profile under provider:
      profile: slsuser

serverless.yml config for new DynamoDB table:

 resources:
   Resources:
     AuctionsTable:
       Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
       Properties:
         TableName: AuctionsTable
         BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
         AttributeDefinitions:
           - AttributeName: id
             AttributeType: S
         KeySchema:
           - AttributeName: id
             KeyType: HASH
